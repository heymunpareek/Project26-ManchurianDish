Veg Manchurian Gravy (With Sauce) – Makes for a tasty Chinese Main Course. Goes best with fried rice, schezwan fried rice or steamed rice.
Veg Manchurian Dry – An excellent starter snack or as a side dish with hakka noodles or chow mein.
Veg manchurian gravy recipe has a sauce or gravy in which the fried veggies balls are tossed and dunked.

The sauce has a mix of eclectic flavors and tastes like sweet, savory, spicy, sour and umami. The recipe is also vegan.
Manchurian in the Indian lingo is a term for fried veggies or fried meat (fish or prawns or chicken) in this spicy-umami sauce.

You can also call the sauce as manchurian sauce. Manchurian and many other Indian Chinese recipes were an invention of the Chinese community living in Kolkata.

This Chinese style of cooking was largely adapted to suit the Indian palate and also to have more vegetarian options in the cuisine.

I love Indo Chinese food. So much was my love for making Chinese food at home that in my teens I would make three of my favorite Indo Chinese recipes often – Chilli Paneer, Corn Soup and Vegetable Manchurian.

The manchurian recipe presented here is a tried and tested recipe, like all my recipes. the result was a yummy veg manchurian that was excellent with plain steamed rice.
How to make veg manchurian gravy
For ease of reading, I have divided this post into 3 main parts.

Step 1 – making veg manchurian balls
Step 2 – frying veg manchurian balls
Step 3 – making manchurian gravy or sauce
Lets start with step 1 – Making vegetable balls

1. Take the finely chopped or grated veggies in a bowl.  you will need ½ cup finely chopped red cabbage, ½ cup grated carrot, ¼ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper), ¼ cup finely chopped french beans and ¼ cup finely chopped spring onions. You can also add regular green cabbage instead of red or purple cabbage.

2. Then add the dry ingredients – 2 tablespoons corn starch, 2 tablespoons all purpose flour (maida), ½ teaspoon black pepper and ½ teaspoon salt or add as required.

3. Mix and gather the whole mixture together. Then kind of mix and knead so that the veggies leave the water and you get a dough-like mixture. But do not knead like that a bread or roti dough. Gluten strands can form that will give a dense chewy texture in the fried veggie balls. So just mix very well and press so that the veggies release their juices.

4. Then take a small portion of the mixture in your hands.

5. Press and roll it in your palm and make a round veggie ball.

6. Make all veggie balls this way and keep aside. You can spread some oil on your palms while making the vegetable balls.

Step 2 – Frying vegetable balls

7. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Add a small piece of a ball to the hot oil. If the balls does not stick or settle down at the bottom of the pan, but comes up steadily the oil is ready for frying these veggie balls. If the balls break, then some more binding agent is required. So you can add 2 to 3 teaspoons of some more all-purpose flour (maida).

8. Gently place the balls in the hot oil. The oil has to be medium hot. Too much heat and the manchurian balls will be browned from top and uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the balls absorb too much oil.

9. When cooked from one side, turn the balls with a slotted spoon.

10. Fry the balls till crisp and golden turning them over a couple of times. Remove them with a slotted or perforated spoon and drain as much as oil as possible.

Step 3: Making the sauce



14. In a small bowl take the following three sauces – ½ tablespoon soy sauce (or 1.5 teaspoons soy sauce), 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup, 2 to 3 teaspoons of red chilli sauce. The red chilli sauce is spicy and not sweet.

Tips
Expert Tips
Grated or minced veggies: To make veg manchurian you need grated or minced veggies like – cabbage, carrots, capsicum, beans & spring onions (scallions). So you can chop the vegetables in a food processor or chop it with a knife. But using a food processor will save your time.
Soy Sauce: It is best to use naturally fermented soy sauce. You can even use bragg liquid aminos or tamari. While making any recipe with soy sauce in it, I would suggest to use naturally fermented soy sauce or bragg liquid aminos or tamari.
Tomato Ketchup – Do use a good quality or homemade tomato ketchup.
Red Chilli Sauce – To add some heat and pungency red chilli sauce is added. Note that you can use sriracha sauce in place of red chilli sauce.
Gluten free options – To bind the flour, use potato starch or tapioca starch in place of corn starch (corn flour). Use rice flour or chickpea flour (besan or gram flour) in place of all-purpose flour (maida).
No MSG (Ajinomoto) –  I do not add msg or ajinomoto in any of the recipes I make. If you want you can add a pinch of it in this recipe.
Serving Suggestions – Veg Manchurian Gravy goes well with Fried Rice, Schezwan Fried Rice or steamed rice or noodles or vegetable noodles. You can also serve it bread or soft dinner rolls or naan or roti.

Notes
Consistency: The best part of most Indian-Chinese recipes is you can change the consistency as per your liking. If you want a thin consistency, add some veg broth or water. If you want a thick consistency, add a few teaspoons of cornflour paste. This dish thickens after it cools down. So when reheating you may have to add some water.
Ajinomoto (MSG): I have not added any msg to the recipe. If you want a more restaurant style effect, you can do so. But a word of caution – msg or mono sodium glutamate is not good for the health.
Frying: Remember to fry the veg manchurian balls on medium heat. If they are fried on a high heat, then the outside will get cooked and the inside will be not cooked leaving a doughy taste in the mouth. If they are fried on a low heat, they will absorb oil and this will make them oily and soggy.
Sugar: I like the sweet sour taste of Indo Chinese food and hence I have added raw sugar to the recipe. You can use any other sweetener like palm sugar or coconut sugar instead of sugar. 
Soy Sauce: Use naturally fermented soy sauce. The soy sauce I use does not have any sugar added to it. You may avoid this or check the ingredients list in your soy sauce if sugar is there in it or not.

About Dry Vegetable Manchurian
Veg Manchurian Dry is a crispy starter snack of fried veg balls tossed in the spicy, sweet, tangy manchurian sauce.

It is one of the dishes that we order when we have dinner in an Indian-Chinese restaurant. It is one of my favorite dish from childhood. I have been making veg manchurian from from my teens. I make both gravy and the dry versions.



On occasions I make this dry manchurian version as a side dish with veg noodles.

veg manchurian dry recipe, dry vegetable manchurian dry recipe
The only time taking part in making dry vegetable manchurian is the grating or chopping the veggies. So the recipe does take time to prepare with frying the vegetable balls and then preparing the sauce.



For less work you can make the veg balls a day before and use them the next day. You can even use a food processor of a food chopper to ease your work.

Serve Veg Manchurian Dry as a starter snack or as a side dish with Hakka Noodles or Veg Chow Mein.
